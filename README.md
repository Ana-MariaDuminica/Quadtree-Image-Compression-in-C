# Quadtree-Image-Compression-in-C
A C program implementing image compression using a quadtree structure. The program processes PPM images and constructs a quadtree based on average color values and a user-defined threshold. It supports calculating tree properties (levels, blocks, and largest block) and outputs the quadtree to a binary file.
